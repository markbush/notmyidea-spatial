# notmyidea-spatial

A copy of the [notmyidea](https://docs.getpelican.com/) theme from Pelican designed for the Spatial Web.

This theme enhances the `notmyidea` theme to support [spatial browsing](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/visionos-26-introduces-powerful-new-spatial-experiences-for-apple-vision-pro/) on the [Apple Vision Pro](https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/).
In particular, it presents (most) individual images in a way in which [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) will automatically convert them into spatial scenes.
